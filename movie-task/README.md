### ⚡ **Getting Started**

Make sure you have nodejs installed by running the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If the output is not the version of your nodejs installation, install nodejs from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### ⏳ **Installing Packages**

To run application on local environment you need to install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### 💾 **Starting the Development Server**

To start the whole application server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### 🔨 **Building**

```bash
npm build
```

### 💻 **Editor setup**

I used eslint for js linting, and prettier for code formating, make sure you install eslint and prettier plugins in your editor so you can
see linting errors as you code and have your code formatted on save by prettier. If formatOnSave doesn't work you can google how to set up
format on save for the eslint & prettier plugins in your editor 🙃
